 * Problem Name: Find Pivot Problem statement: Given an array, you have to
nd the index where the sum of all numbers to the left of the index is equal
to the sum of all numbers to the right of index. Your task: Given an array,
you have to nd the index where the sum of all numbers to the left of the
index is equal to the sum of all numbers to the right of index. If the index is
on the left edge of the array, then the left sum is 0 because there are no
elements to the left. This also applies to the right edge of the array. Return
the leftmost pivot index. If no such index exists, return -1.
